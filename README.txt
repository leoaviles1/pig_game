GAME RULES:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls the two dice as many times as he/she whishes. Each result get added to his current ROUND score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn. (Hint: Always save the previous dice roll in a separate variable)
-The first player to reach the winning score on the GLOBAL score wins the game
-If playing another round, the winning player will go first!

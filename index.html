        <h2>Game Rules:</h2>
        <p>The game has two players, playing in rounds</p>
        <p>
          Rule #1: A player rolls the two dice as many times as he/she whishes. Each result get
          added to their current <b>ROUND</b> score.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rule #2: If the player rolls a <b>1</b>, all their <b>ROUND</b> score gets lost. After
          that, it's the next player's turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rule #3: The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their <b>ROUND</b> score gets
          added to their <b>GLOBAL</b> score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rule #4: A player looses their <b>ENTIRE</b> score when he rolls two <b>6's</b> in a row.
          After that, it's the next player's turn.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>
          The first player to reach the <b>winning score</b> on their <b>GLOBAL</b> score wins the
          game!
